# PDEng Tutorial "On Deep Learning"
Tutorial "On Deep Learning"
https://github.com/jpcpereira/pdeng_tutorial_deep_learning

This is a tutorial I prepared for my colleagues in the PDEng program Data Science at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science.
I divided it in three sessions:
- Part 1: Introduction to neural networks for machine learning. ()
- Part 2: Advanced model architectures (Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks).
- Practical coding session focusing on three applications of the architectures covered: fraud detection (anomaly detection), times series forecasting (regression), and time series classification (classification).

## Materials
Part 1 and 2 slides are merged in the .pdf file "On_Deep_Learning".
Pratical sessions slides are in the file "On_Deep_Learning_Practical" and code are the three Jupyter Notebooks in the repository: fraud_detection.ipynb, time_series_classification.ipynb, and time_series_forecasting.ipynb.
